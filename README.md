## Introduction

As the state deals with the effects of environmental change and the drought, California government seeks to find innovative ways to reduce waste in resources and increase sustainable practices. As part of the Innovation Contest (AB 2138- Gatto), the Government Operations Agency and the Department of General Services are looking for innovative solutions that will help California improve its sustainable operations and engage with the public. We want the public to leverage the pilot Statewide Open Data Portal and use publicly available data sources to help citizens and decision makers understand the state’s progress on achieving sustainability goals and to help policymakers and implementers inside state government make informed decisions.   

Drawing at least one data set available through the pilot Statewide Open Data Portal, this innovation contest will focus on creating apps, visualizations, and other tools that can help improve government sustainability practices. Contestants should be able to harness and visualize data sets to empower citizens and policy makers with data to evaluate the progress of each department toward established sustainability goals that will lead to better informed policy and implementation decisions.

**Visually engaging sustainability tools could include, but not be limited, a dashboard that:**
- Reports departments’ progress toward established sustainability goals. Consider the Green Buildings Website as a stater point: http://greenbuildings.ca.gov/ 
- Incorporates as many of the data sets provided as possible, as well as other publicly available data sources.
- Automatically updates as data sets in data portal are updated.

**$25,000 in prize money will be awarded by the following breakdown:**
- $10,000 for the first place winner
- $7,500 for the second place winner
- $5,000 for the third place winner
- $2,500 for the People’s Choice

## Judging Criteria

### Participants will be judged based on the following criteria:

#### Effective use of data sets from the Open Data Portal. (Teams are welcome to use data from other sources as well.): (20 points)
- Do you use data sets from the Open Data portal? Do you incorporate relevant data sets not currently on greenbuildings.ca.gov or the portal? Did you use any of the ESRI GIS mapping tools? Does the concept address any of the Governor's sustainability goals? Could it significantly improve or potentially replace current practice? Would decision makers use it? 

#### Innovation and creativity: (20 points)
- Is your goal clearly stated and unique? Is there real-world potential to produce a breakthrough or a major change that would improve the state’s operational improvements in sustainability? Does your project tackle a problem that has been overlooked/ignored in the past, or attack a problem with a new angle / on a bigger scale / on a higher level? Does your goal focused on a definable business problem? 

#### User-friendliness, usability and interface: (30 points)
- Is it easy to navigate and intuitive? Does it significantly improve the data visualizations in the existing green buildings website?  Is it inclusive of all audiences? Does is address 508 compliance needs per the ADA? 

#### Feasibility of implementation: (30 points)
- Does the concept appear to be practical and effective? Does it work as is, or does it require additional resources (code or data?) Do you address potential needs/challenges? Does it operate on multiple computing platforms?

### Participants should *consider* the following:
- Enabling users to access the finest granularity of data possible. Examples include individual facility data and rolled up department level data.
- Displaying information in a way that easily conveys progress and areas of needed improvement.
- Provides the finest temporal granularity available in the data.  An example includes monthly, rather than annual utility usage.
